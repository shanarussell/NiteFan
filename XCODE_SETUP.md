# Adding Modern UI Files to Xcode

The modern UI files have been created but need to be added to your Xcode project. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open Your Project in Xcode
```bash
open NiteFan/NiteFan.xcodeproj
```

## Step 2: Add the New Swift Files to Your Project

1. In Xcode, right-click on the `NiteFan` folder (the one containing `ViewController.swift`)
2. Select **"Add Files to NiteFan..."**
3. Navigate to your project directory and select these three files:
   - `ModernViewController.swift`
   - `FanAnimationView.swift`
   - `UIColor+NiteFan.swift`
4. Make sure these options are checked:
   - ‚úÖ Copy items if needed (should be unchecked since files are already in the folder)
   - ‚úÖ Add to targets: NiteFan
5. Click **Add**

## Step 3: Enable the Modern UI

After adding the files to Xcode, you need to update SceneDelegate.swift:

1. Open `SceneDelegate.swift` in Xcode
2. Find the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method
3. Replace the current implementation with:

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
    
    // Use the modern UI
    window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
    window?.rootViewController = ModernViewController()
    window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
}
```

## Step 4: Build and Run

1. Press `‚åò+B` to build the project
2. Fix any build errors that appear
3. Press `‚åò+R` to run the app

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Cannot find type 'ModernViewController' in scope":
- Make sure the files are added to the correct target (NiteFan)
- In Xcode, select each file and check the File Inspector (right panel)
- Under "Target Membership", ensure "NiteFan" is checked

### If the old UI still appears:
- Clean build folder: `‚åò+Shift+K`
- Delete the app from simulator
- Build and run again: `‚åò+R`

### To switch between old and new UI:
- **For Modern UI**: Use `ModernViewController()` in SceneDelegate
- **For Classic UI**: Use the storyboard instantiation code (currently active)

## File Descriptions

- **ModernViewController.swift**: The main view controller with the modern UI
- **FanAnimationView.swift**: Custom animated fan view with Core Animation
- **UIColor+NiteFan.swift**: Color extensions for dark/light mode support
